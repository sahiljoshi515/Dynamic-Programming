Memoization Recipe

1.) Make it work. (Could be slow, it's okay)
    - Visualize the problem as a tree.
    - Implement the tree using recursion.
    - Test it.

2.) Make it efficient. (Think how can you memoize it)
    - Add a memo object.
    - Add a base case to return memo values.
    - Store return values into the memo.
